The above posters are examples of the work I did for Art Hawks, a First Year Leadership Program on the Laurier Brantford campus.

They were created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.

<br>

This poster was created in my high school Communications Technology class.

The project was to create a concert poster for our favourite artist. Fun fact: Harry Styles is still my favourite!

# My Angle

When it comes to prototyping, it's important to ensure that you are doing all the preliminary steps before starting a prototype. In this assignment, I made sure to perform all of my user research and analysis before beginning work on a low fidelity prototype. Virtual product prototyping aided me in creating this low, medium, and high fidelity prototype for my project since I could not create it physically (Nam et al. 2019).
